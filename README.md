# Game Project: Connect 4

A university project focused on creating a **Connect 4** game using the **Racket** programming language.

## Overview
This project implements a classic **2-player Connect 4** game, where players take turns dropping pieces into a grid. The objective is for a player to connect four of their pieces in a row — vertically, horizontally, or diagonally — before their opponent.

## Features
- **Two-Player Gameplay**: Play head-to-head against another player.
- **Turn-Based Mechanics**: Alternating turns ensure fair play.
- **Winning Conditions**: Automatic detection of winning sequences (4 in a row).
- **Basic Racket UI**: Provides a simple interface for placing pieces in columns.

## Technology
- **Racket**: Functional programming language used to build game logic and interface.

## How to Play
1. Players take turns choosing a column to drop their piece.
2. The first player to connect four pieces in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
3. If the grid fills up without a winning sequence, the game ends in a draw.

## Credits
- **Developed as part of a university assessment.**
